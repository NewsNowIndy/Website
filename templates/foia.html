    <h3>APRA FAQs</h3>
  
    <div style="margin-bottom:1rem">
      <p><strong>Who may access public records?</strong></p>
      <p>
        The explicit policy statement and statutory language of the APRA permit all persons
        access to public records. A “person” includes individuals as well as corporations,
        limited liability companies, partnerships, associations and governmental entities.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom:1rem">
        <p><strong>What kinds of documents may be accessed?</strong></p>
        <p>
            To be required to be accessible, a document
            must be a public record from a public agency. The
            APRA defines a public record as
            . . . any writing, paper, report, study, map,
            photograph, book, card, tape recording, or other
            material that is created, received, retained,
            maintained, or filed by or with a public agency
            and which is generated on paper, paper
            substitutes, photographic media, chemically
            based media, magnetic or machine readable
            media, electronically stored data, or any other
            material, regardless of form or characteristics.
            I.C. § 5-14-3-2.
             I.C. § 5-14-3-2 defines public agency very
            broadly to include boards, commissions,
            departments, divisions, bureaus, committees,
            agencies and offices exercising administrative,
            judicial or legislative power; counties, townships,
            cities, towns, law enforcement agencies; school
            corporations; advisory commissions, committees
            and bodies; license branches; the lottery
            commission; the gaming commission; the horse
            racing commission; and a private university
            police department. Additionally, any entity that is
            subject to audit by the State Board of Accounts 
            by statute, rule, or regulation is a public agency
            for purposes of the APRA. An entity that is
            maintained or supported, in whole or in part, by
            public funds may fall within the APRA, and,
            therefore, its records are accessible.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom:1rem">
        <p><strong>What records may not be accessed?</strong></p>
        <p>
            The stated policy of the APRA and its broad definition of public records make most documents
            accessible to the public. But the APRA specifically excludes certain types of documents from
            disclosure. These exceptions can be found in I.C. &sect; 5-14-3-4. In determining whether a particular
            record is excepted from disclosure under the APRA, Indiana courts interpret these exceptions
            narrowly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Under I.C. &sect; 5-14-3-4(a), certain records cannot be disclosed by a public agency unless disclosure
            is specifically required by state or federal statute, or is ordered by a court under the rules of
            discovery. I.C. 5-14-3-4(a) is not an exhaustive list of records considered confidential pursuant to
            state law. Various provisions throughout the Indiana Code declare certain records confidential.
            The most commonly cited exceptions found in I.C. &sect; 5-14-3-4(a) include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
            Records made confidential by state statute, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Juvenile Law Enforcement Records (IC 31-39-3, 31-39-4)</li>
                <li>Juvenile Court Records (IC 31-39-2)</li>
                <li>Protective Orders (IC 5-2-9-6); Address Confidentiality Program (IC 5-26.5-2)</li>
                <li>Confidential Motor Vehicle Records (IC 9-14-3-9)</li>
                <li>Victim Addresses (IC 11-13-3-4)</li>
                <li>TANF Records (IC 12-14-1-7)</li>
                <li>Patient Treatment Records (IC 12-23-18-5.6)</li>
                <li>School Records (IC 31-39-6-1)</li>
                <li>Hotline Calls (IC 31-33-18-5)</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Records made confidential by rule adopted by a public agency under specific authority</li>
            <li>Records made confidential by federal law (e.g., FERPA, 20 U.S.C. &sect; 1232g et seq.)</li>
            <li>Records containing trade secrets</li>
            <li>Records containing confidential financial information received upon request from a person</li>
            <li>Grade transcripts and license examination scores</li>
            <li>Records made confidential by rules adopted by the Indiana Supreme Court</li>
            <li>Patient medical records and charts created by a health care provider (unless the patient consents in writing)</li>
            <li>A photograph, video recording, or audio recording of an autopsy</li>
            <li>A Social Security number contained in the records of a public agency</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            In certain circumstances, APRA grants public agencies discretion in determining which public records
            should be disclosed. I.C. &sect; 5-14-3-4(b) provides public agencies the discretion to withhold the
            following records from public access. Common discretionary exceptions under 4(b) include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Investigatory records of law enforcement agencies (records compiled during the course of a criminal investigation).
                However, under I.C. &sect; 5-14-3-5, certain factual information—such as the identity of a person arrested or jailed and
                the agency’s response to a complaint, accident, or incident—must be made available to the public.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="qa-block">
        <p><strong>May I request information in the form of a list?</strong></p>
        <p>
          The Act provides that a public agency is not required to create and release a list of names and addresses upon request.
          If a list of names has been compiled, or if a public agency maintains a list of information under some statutory
          requirement, the list is accessible to the public. In general, however, a public agency is not required to create a
          “list” to satisfy a public records request. But an agency that maintains its records on an “electronic data storage
          system” must make a reasonable effort to satisfy a request for information from that system.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a commercial entity requests a list that contains the names and addresses of:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>the employees of a public agency,</li>
          <li>the people attending conferences or meetings at a state institution of higher education, or</li>
          <li>students enrolled in a public school corporation which adopts a policy that such information need not be released,</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          the public agency may not permit a commercial entity access to the list when the list is sought for a commercial purpose.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="qa-block">
        <p><strong>When can public records be accessed?</strong></p>
        <p>
          The APRA permits the public access to public records during the regular business hours of the particular public agency
          from which the records are sought. On occasion, part-time public officials may have limited business hours. The APRA
          does not require a public agency to be open for any particular hours of the day, but it is the responsibility of the
          public official to ensure there is adequate time for persons who wish to inspect and copy records. Once a public agency
          indicates there are disclosable public records which will be provided in response to a request, the compilation and
          copying of the records may not unreasonably interfere with the regular business of that agency.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="qa-block">
        <p><strong>What are the public agency’s responsibilities when I submit a request?</strong></p>
        <p>
          If a requestor is physically present in the office of the public agency or makes a request by telephone or requests
          enhanced access to a document, the public agency must respond to the request within 24 hours after any employee of the
          agency receives the request. If a request is mailed or sent by facsimile or email, a public agency must respond within
          seven calendar days of the receipt of that request. The APRA requires only a response and not the actual production of
          records within this specified time period.
        </p>
        <p>
          The APRA requires that all records must be produced in a reasonable period of time, considering the facts and
          circumstances. See Appendix B for a checklist for agencies responding to requests under the APRA.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="qa-block">
        <p><strong>May a public agency deny a request?</strong></p>
        <p>
          In general, if a requested record (1) is a public record from a public agency; (2) is not exempt from disclosure; and
          (3) is identified with reasonable particularity pursuant to I.C. &sect; 5-14-3-3(a), the public agency cannot deny access
          to the record.
        </p>
        <p>
          If access to a public record would reveal disclosable and nondisclosable information, the information that is
          disclosable must be made available for inspection. The public agency must separate, or redact, the nondisclosable
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oral requests made by telephone or in person may be denied orally. If a request is made in writing, by facsimile or
          by email, or if an oral request that was denied is renewed in writing, the public agency may only deny the request in
          writing. A denial must include a statement of the specific statutory reason for nondisclosure of the information and
          the name and title of the person responsible for the denial.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="qa-block">
        <p><strong>What if a public agency denies my request?</strong></p>
        <p>
          If a person feels he or she has been wrongly denied, that person should contact the Public Access Counselor for an
          informal response or to file a formal complaint. See Sections 5 and 6 of this handbook for more information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The APRA authorizes an individual who has been denied access to a public record to file a civil lawsuit in the circuit
          or superior court of the county in which the denial occurred. The purpose of the lawsuit is to compel disclosure of the
          records sought. When such a lawsuit is filed, the public agency must notify each person who supplied a part of the
          public record in dispute that a request for its release has been denied.
        </p>
        <p>
          The burden of proof then falls upon the public agency to establish that it properly denied access to the public record
          because the record falls outside the scope of the Act. If certain conditions are met, the prevailing party is entitled
          to reasonable attorney fees, court costs and other litigation expenses. Further, a civil penalty may be assessed by the
          court if a request for records is denied with the specific intent to unlawfully withhold a record that is subject to
          disclosure under the APRA. See I.C. 5-14-3-9.5.
